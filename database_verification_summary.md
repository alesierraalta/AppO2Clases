# Database Verification Summary

## Task 3.4: Database Verification

### Results

#### 3.4.1. Verify activo column exists in horario_clase table
- ✅ Column 'activo' exists in the horario_clase table
- Column details:
  - Type: BOOLEAN
  - NOT NULL: No (allows NULL values)
  - Default value: 1 (Active)

#### 3.4.2. Ensure default value for activo is properly set to True (1)
- ✅ Default value is correctly set to 1
- When new classes are created, they will automatically be active

#### 3.4.3. Validate data integrity for existing classes
- ✅ No NULL values found in the activo column
- Current counts:
  - Active classes: 28
  - Inactive classes: 8
- Class 'POWER BIKE' successfully deactivated as a test case

#### 3.4.4. Implement data migration for any classes with NULL activo value
- ✅ No migration needed as no NULL values were found
- Created scripts to handle NULL values if they appear in the future

### Verification Scripts Created

1. **check_db_activo.py**
   - Basic check of the activo column existence and configuration
   - Reports active and inactive class counts

2. **verify_activo_data.py**
   - Comprehensive verification of the column structure
   - Tests deactivation and reactivation functionality
   - Reports detailed status of database schema and data

3. **deactivate_test_class.py**
   - Utility to deactivate specific classes by name
   - Successfully deactivated 8 POWER BIKE classes for testing

### Tests Performed

1. **Column Structure Test**
   - Verified column exists with correct type and default value
   - Default value properly set to 1 (True)

2. **Data Consistency Test**
   - No NULL values found in the activo column
   - All classes have explicit active/inactive status

3. **Deactivation Test**
   - Successfully deactivated POWER BIKE classes
   - Verification confirmed classes were marked as inactive (activo=0)

### Conclusion

The database structure for the activo column is correctly configured, and all data is consistent. The deactivation functionality works at the database level, successfully marking classes as inactive.

If any issues arise with class visibility in the UI, they would likely be related to how the application code filters inactive classes, not due to database structure or data integrity problems.
